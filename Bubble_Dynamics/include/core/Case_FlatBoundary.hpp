/*! \class Case_FlatBoundary
    \brief Derived class: handles the dynamics of fluid-fluid interface that has been initiated as a 'infinite' flat surface.

    The fluid-fluid interface is taken as initially flat and located at z = 0 with potentials on both side equal to zero.
    This derived class inherits members from BoundaryData.cpp and BoundaryData.hpp.
